# Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Frontend development servers used in this project included the three mentioned in the question but all had different uses and advantages. The single-page application made it easier for the user to interact with pages and complete actions without switching from page to page. The Express HTML helped this process by creating pages that showed these actions to the user in an organized fashion. The JavaScript created the controllers and models for the application to seamlessly deliver the actions. 

# Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
A noSQL MongoDB database is great for applications that have a lot of data but not many actions. The data is saved in the database as to not create a lot of classes and code in the application and keeps it safe behind the authentication. 

# How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces? 
JSON tied together the front and backend developments by taking the code from Javascript and applying it to the front end processes. JSON can store data and routes but cannot use functions that Javascript can. 

# Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
I refactored code into handlebars for the headers and footers of the application in order to create less programming when the header and footer stayed consistent throughout the different pages. Similarly, the HTML components of pages were created into single controllers to be called upon when needed. 


# Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

Methods and enpoints create the security in the application to verify users by using the key found in the application to verify the password to the user. I do understand how this is supposed to work but it did create issues when excecuting it. I am not sure where I went wrong in the verification when editing or adding trips. 

# How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This course has helped me take my learning to a new level of excecution. It is one thing to read about these methods or be given examples but actually editing all of the code and finding little errors was very important to my growth in this field. I feel as if I am more marketable as I now know where to look when errors occur and I understand the flor of the application more.
